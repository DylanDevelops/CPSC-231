SOURCES
I worked on the project alone and didn't work with any other students.
However, I used three online resources, which were as follows:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19648240/the-best-way-to-print-a-java-2d-array (Used for understanding further how to write out char arrays to the console.)
    - https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html (Used for learning how to correctly write JavaDoc.)
