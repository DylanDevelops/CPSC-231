SOURCES
I assisted Divi Newton on his project but had no help with my own.
However, I used two online resources, which were official Oracle documentation on Javadoc and the Chapman Coding Guidelines:
    - https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html (Used for learning how to correctly write JavaDoc.)
    - https://file.notion.so/f/f/bb2414b6-dc5b-48c8-91d6-c4e0d4496389/32052367-2a6c-4434-8fd2-cecf91f2515e/Chapman_Coding_Standards.pdf?id=33709c94-c7d7-4f49-9a34-3ddc4c78fe34&table=block&spaceId=bb2414b6-dc5b-48c8-91d6-c4e0d4496389&expirationTimestamp=1709517600000&signature=NA9CD-bjE5GNQde3aQA2uRhCYlPwCr1CmRZRGUXIxlk&downloadName=Chapman+Coding+Standards.pdf (Followed to adhere to Chapman coding practices)
